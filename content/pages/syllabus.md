Description
-----------

This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of quantum computation. Topics covered include:

*   (Just) enough quantum mechanics to understand quantum computation.
*   Quantum algorithms.
    *   Simon's algorithm
    *   The prime factorization algorithm
    *   Grover's search algorithm
*   Mathematical models of quantum computation, their relationships to each other, and to physical systems.
*   Quantum error correcting codes
*   Quantum cryptography
*   Quantum fault tolerance

Prerequisites
-------------

Understanding of linear algebra. Prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is helpful, but not required. Permission of instructor is required.
